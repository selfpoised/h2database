# tools for reading source code 

### class hierarchy
it is very useful to draw class hierarchy, call graph, which are a great helper in understanding the 
source code. After comparing several tools doing this job, be it intellij idea ultimate or eclipse plugins, i found class visulizer and doxygen great, and simple to use.

##### class visulizer
[class-visualizer](http://www.class-visualizer.net/faq.html)

##### doxygen
[使用Doxygen把代码文档化](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25820237)
